# WordCountDown_Game
*Theory Of Algorithms
##Project Brief
*You are required to create two pieces: a Python script that solves the Countdown letters game, and a document explaining how your solver works. The Countdown letters game is as detailed on Wikipedia. Esentially, you are given a list of nine random letters which contains at least three vowels and four consonants. You must find the longest possible word in the Oxford English dictionary that is an anagram of some or all of the letters in the random list. If there is more than one word of longest length, then each is as acceptable a solution as the others.


###Global variables
| I first create a *Global Variables* as show below:- |

| Description | Code |
|---| ---|
| `*I first create a Global Variables whis are:-*` | 
| `*List of word that matches and reach requiremen*`      |`words =[]`|
| `*This is random generated word*`                      |`letters=[]`|
| `*Set of Vowels*`                                  |`vowels="aeiou"`|
| `*Set of consonants*`          |`consonants="bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz"`|
| `*Set of all vowels & consonants*`| `l="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"`|
